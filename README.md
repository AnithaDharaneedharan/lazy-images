# lazy-images

How Lazy Loading Works? 
When someone adds a resource to a web page (image, video, etc.), the resource references a small placeholder. 
As a user browses the web page, the actual resource is cached by the browser and replaces the placeholder when the resource becomes visible on the user's screen

Intersection Observer API:
It provides a way to asynchronously observe changes in the target element with an ancestor or top level document's viewport

This project create the intersection observer by calling its constructor and passing it a callback function to be run
whenever a threshold is crossed in one direction or the other
